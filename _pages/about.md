I am a master's student in the field of robotics, graduated from Dalian University of Technology[NUDT](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/). My main research areas are path planning, image segmentation, and object detection. I am fortunate to be supervised by Associate Professor Li Junxiang[Prof] at the National University of Defense Technology.
